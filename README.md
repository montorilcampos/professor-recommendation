# Professor Recommendation Algorithm

This project uses the Kaggle dataset "Rate My Professor Reviews 5C Colleges" ([found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tilorc/rate-my-professor-reviews-5c-colleges)) to create a streamlit website where users can choose a course and receive the overall best professor for that course. It parses through and analyzes the user-submitted text reviews to create sentiment scores for each professor, and find the overall best professor for a certain course based on various categories. Additionally, it also uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to extract the most important keywords from the text reviews.
